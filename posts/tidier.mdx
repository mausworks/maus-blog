Consistency is bliss&mdash;and linters such as ESLint and formatters such as ESLint quickly proved that
once they became the de-facto standard for defining code standards for many software development projects.

In my opinion; tools such as these have revolutionized the industry, 
seeing as they have swiftly ended disagreements on how code should be formatted,
so we can focus on more important disagreements such as if a boolean really must always start with "is",
or whether concise or exhaustive variable names are better.

Jokes aside, I think the fact of the matter is that people often disagree with each other,
but they seldom seem to disagree with their toolset, especially if said tools _also fixes the code_.

Sure&mdash;I can disagree with a code formatting rule. But once fixes are applied 
(either by a pre-commit hook, or by "format on save"), I no longer care: and I think most developers share this sentiment.

Since I started working in a large software development project, within a very large monorepo,
I quickly noticed something: We have consistent code style across most projects within this repository,
but the way we name files and folders is _highly inconsistent, sometimes even within the same project_,
and being a highly meticulous individual, I wanted to immerse myself in this problem space to see if I can do something about it.

The result of this adventure is Tidier&mdash;a project linter and formatter.
