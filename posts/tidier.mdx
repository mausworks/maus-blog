Consistency is bliss&mdash;and linters such as ESLint and formatters such as prettier quickly proved that
once they became the ubiquitous standard for defining code conventions for many software development projects.

In my opinion; tools such as these have revolutionized the industry, 
seeing as they have swiftly ended disagreements on how code should be formatted,
so we can focus on more important disagreements such as whether a boolean must always start with "is",
or whether concise or exhaustive variable names are better.

Jokes aside, I think the fact of the matter is that people often disagree with each other,
but they seldom seem to disagree with their toolset, especially if said tools _also fixes the code_.

Sure&mdash;I can disagree with a code formatting rule. But once fixes are applied 
(either by a pre-commit hook, or by "format on save"), I no longer care, and I think most developers share this sentiment.

Since I started working in a large software development project, within a very large monorepo,
I quickly noticed something: We have consistent code style across most projects within this repository,
but the way we name files and folders is _highly inconsistent, sometimes even within the same project_,
and being a highly meticulous individual, I wanted to immerse myself in this problem space to see if I can do something about it.

The result of this venture is Tidier&mdash;a project linter and formatter.

## The problem space

Naming conventions for files and folders are usually very straight forward.
JavaScript projects usually use `camelCase` or `kebab-case`,
in C# it is highly unconventional to not use `PascalCase` for everything, 
and in Python `snake_case` seems to be the way to go.

But as always, there are edge cases. As an example: React projects almost always use `PascalCase` for components,
and if you have tests for your component, you commonly add `.spec` or `.test` to the name of the file,
and this part of the the name should still be in lowercase.

So with this in mind, it became clear that to solve this in a somewhat generic way,
you need to be able to define different rules depending on whether something is a file or folder,
and you need to be able to do wildcard matching, and after a bit of testing, 
it became clear that glob matching is the way to go!

Ultimately&mdash;what the end-user is going to interact with,
and what dictates the functionality of the program is going to be the configuration,
so this felt like a natural starting point.

What I came up with, and what the configuration still looks like is this:

```json
{
  "files": { 
    "**/*.js": "kebab-case"
  },
  "folders": {
    "**/*": "kebab-case"
  }
}
```

Using Tidier with this configuration, ensures that all `.js`-files and all folders use `kebab-case`.
